## Elevator Pitch

You're an analog IC designer. Oh well. Time to do some rough hand calculations based on overdrive voltage only to plug the widths and length into Cadence Virtuoso and find out _nothing_ is working when you fire up ADE L... _Again_... You've heard of the gm/id method and find it intriguing only to fumble around five different plots of reference curves you made months ago. There must be an easier way...

If you're a simple mortal like me who would like to make the process of gm/id a bit less painful then the python-analog-designer might be for you.
